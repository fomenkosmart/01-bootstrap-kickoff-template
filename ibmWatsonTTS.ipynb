        "inputTXT = \"Hello and welcome to another XTON quick take. In this episode, I show you how to unlock a secured field. This quick take has two parts: First — “what is a secured field” and the second — “what does unlock means”. Let’s take a look at “what is a secured field”. A secured field is any field in a record, that is used to conceal or secure its object from a specific user or group and this is done using permissions. It’s all you need to know what a Secured field is. The second part is the Unlocking. When you want to unlock the secured field (which basically means you want to expose that secured of that concealed object). You simply come here and click the unlock button. This will allow you  then you are the user of the system to see what it is that’s being that was secured. Now let’s log in as a user who does have the unlock permission. Here I do not have the same permissions as the service administrator account and I will go and will access the same record as an auditor. You can see here try to do it side by side that the secured fields are still secured obviously: I cannot see them, cannot click on them or select them or download those objects nor do I have the unlock button. While we’re here, you can also notice that you can connect. Even though this user cannot see the password, this user still has the ability to use this system to connect. So, let’s switch back to the Service Administrator view. Let’s click the actual button. And what happens when you click to unlock? The client is communicating with the database in order to reveal that secured field. And one more important thing in this video is the Audit log. Down here for the record, you have the Audit log option. The Audit log for this view is going to tell you everything that happened with this record. You can see the couple of events that we went through in these past few minutes. We have unlocks, we have locks, timestamps, who has been performed them. All these events will be recorded for you and accessible so that if you ever need to investigate, you’ll have all the audit information available to you.\"\n",
